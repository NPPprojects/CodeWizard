# Spells

The bracer uses an 8-position digital joystick plus two extra buttons, so every spell has to fit a single tap or toggle. The current firmware exposes three core lighting modes that map neatly onto three spells.

## Controls at a Glance
- Left: switch to **Fireball**.
- Right: switch to **Lightning Surge**.
- Reset: fall back to **Guiding Light**.
- Up / Down: adjust speed or hue depending on the active spell.
- Set: toggle high/low brightness for **Guiding Light**.
- Center: master on/off safety toggle.

## Fireball
- **Trigger**: Tap the joystick left.
- **Theme**: Rolling bands of ember oranges and deep reds.
- **Motion**: Continuous chase that advances a few degrees of hue each update, giving the sense of fire licking around the bracer.
- **Adjustments**: Up speeds the chase; Down slows it.

## Lightning Surge
- **Trigger**: Tap the joystick right.
- **Theme**: Electric bursts in ice-blue and white.
- **Motion**: Hard strobe that alternates between full-intensity flashes and dark intervals.
- **Adjustments**: Up shortens the strobe interval for rapid strikes; Down lengthens it for deliberate thunderclaps.

## Guiding Light
- **Trigger**: Press the reset button (or on boot).
- **Theme**: Steady radiant glow with selectable hue.
- **Motion**: Static wash; Up nudges the hue forward, Down nudges it backward for simple color tuning.
- **Adjustments**: Tap Set to flip between travel-safe low power and showtime high brightness.

If you later expand the input hardware (analog stick reads, combos, or gesture timing), we can reintroduce additional spell forms with more elaborate motions.
